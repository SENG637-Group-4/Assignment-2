# 1 Introduction

This assignment focuses on black-box testing of five methods selected from two different classes: `org.jfree.data.Range` and `org.jfree.data.DataUtilities`

The `Range` class represents an immutable range of numerical values. It includes 15 methods (both instance and static), such as `combine` and `constrain`, which perform different operations on ranges.

The `DataUtilities` class provides utility methods that support various data-related classes. It contains 5 static methods, including `createNumberArray2D` and `createNumberArray`, which help in creating and managing numerical data structures.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3 Test cases developed

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
